# IOT_Project
Automated Car

A two-wheeled car that is able to switch directions by first reversing and turning right when sensing a barrier in front. The program gets executed in the IDE and communicates with the RF24 radio components attached to the car to initiate the program. A RF24 library is required to communicate with the Thing from the Arduino Web Editor. 

### Requirements 

* Arduino Web Editor
* Arduino Uno R3 Compatible 
* Mini Breadboard
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Servo Motor (360 Degrees Continous Rotation)
* RF24 radio components
* Wires to connect parts to breadboard
